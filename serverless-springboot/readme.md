# To deploy to AWS

* update `build.gradle` with the correct `Main-Class`

  ```jar {
   	manifest {
   		attributes 'Main-Class': 'com.example.serverlessspringboot.ServerlessSpringbootApplication'
   	}
   }```
   
* Create a Custome handler for the function we want to expose, in our case `TransactionServiceRequestHandler`

* Set Environment Variable `FUNCTION_NAME`, (in this caese `saveTransaction` as registered
  via application context initializer) to the function name if there are more than one functions in the uploaded
  jar file
